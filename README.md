# YallaEvents Mobile App

Welcome to the home of **YallaEvents**, a hybrid Flutter application that keeps students in the loop about every campus happening in real time.

## Why YallaEvents?
Students often miss out on talks, workshops, and club socials because the information is scattered. YallaEvents pulls approved events straight from the university event registry and presents them in a single, friendly feed. Less searching, more showing up.

## Core Features
- **Live Event Feed** – automatic sync with the university event system once an event is approved
- **Smart Filters** – pick by category, time, location, or whether there is food
- **Personal Calendar** – add events to the device calendar
- **Push Reminders** – optional reminders so users never miss the fun
- **Event Sharing** – share events with peers

## Tech Stack
TBA.
